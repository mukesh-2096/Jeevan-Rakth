## 📋 Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Every year, thousands of lives are lost in India due to critical blood shortages. The current blood donation ecosystem faces several challenges:

1. **Fragmented Network**: Lack of a centralized platform connecting donors, blood banks, hospitals, and NGOs
2. **Time-Critical Delays**: Finding matching blood donors during emergencies takes too long
3. **Inventory Visibility**: Blood banks and hospitals cannot see real-time blood availability across regions
4. **Geographic Barriers**: Difficulty in locating nearest donors or blood banks in urgent situations
5. **Donor Awareness**: Potential donors are unaware of urgent blood requirements in their vicinity
6. **Manual Coordination**: Heavy reliance on phone calls, social media posts, and manual coordination leading to delays

### The Impact
- **Lives at Risk**: Delayed access to blood during medical emergencies can be fatal
- **Wasted Resources**: Blood units expiring due to poor inventory management
- **Inefficient Matching**: No smart system to match blood type, location, and availability
- **Limited Reach**: Small NGOs and rural hospitals struggle to connect with donor networks
